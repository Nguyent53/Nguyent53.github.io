    <h2>About Us</h2>
   <strong>My Dream School</strong> is a <em>Catholic high school in Toronto</em>, Ontario, Canada. It is administered by the Toronto Catholic District School Board, formerly the Metropolitan Separate School Board. It is named after a Basilian father and founder of the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Carr_(priest)">Henry Carr (1880â€“1963</a><br> 
   Throughout the school's early existence, it operated as a private school for Grades 11 to 13 only while the MSSB educated grade 9 and 10 students. This changed in 1985 when the Government of Ontario passed Bill 30 to extend funding to Roman Catholic high schools beyond grade 10 and Carr was ceased to be a private school in 1987. However, in 1988, nearby Humbergrove Secondary School, built in 1966 on Martin Grove Road, was closed and reopened by the MSSB as Marian Academy with 165 pupils. The school closed its doors in 2002 due to declining enrollment.</br>
The school moved to the former Marian building in September 2007. The My Dream campus, at the cost of $10 million, consisted of the new main entrance, central community atrium, cafeteria, drama studio, labs, three automotive bays, new windows, stonework and landscaping.The former school building was sold to the City of Toronto in 2009 and reopened the old Panorama school building as a community hub. The renovated school was designed by Makrimichalos Cugini Architects Inc. whilst the original school building built in 1966 was designed by architect Gordon S. Adamson.</br>
