        <div> <a href="https://www.idealist.org/en/careers/why-working-across-departments-is-important">The benefits of working across departments:</a>
            <ol>
                <li>Keeping connected even while working remote. Without the opportunity for chance meetings in the hallway, kitchen, or break room, and without in-person meetings to make more substantial contact, it’s far easier for individuals and teams to feel more disconnected in general</li>
                <li>Employees gain a holistic view of the organization’s work</li>
                <li>Working together better fulfills the needs of multiple departments. Collaborative work also allows team members to bring their individual work styles, skills, and perspectives to other projects, giving us the chance to tackle new challenges, as well as opening up possibilities for new solutions and better results.</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="Kim"><strong>The Department of Mathematics at the My Dream School</strong> aspires to serve our community as a welcoming center for learning, communicating, and applying mathematics, while building on our strength as Canada’s preeminent research department in the discipline and a top department worldwide.
