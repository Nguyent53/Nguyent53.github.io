         <a href="https://www.idealist.org/en/careers/why-working-across-departments-is-important">The benefits of working across departments:</a>
        <p class="hello">Many different types of scholarships can be offered with income from a departmental endowment, and they can be offered at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In some cases, the benefactor may provide guidance on this, but optimally it should be driven by the strategic direction of the department. Scholarship money can be used to support diversity and inclusion efforts, for instance. If the department has a new master’s program, then scholarships can be used to attract the top students to that program. And if the department is part of a land-grant university, then scholarship money can be limited to undergraduates from that state.</p>

                <li>Keeping connected even while working remote. Without the opportunity for chance meetings in the hallway, kitchen, or break room, and without in-person meetings to make more substantial contact, it’s far easier for individuals and teams to feel more disconnected in general</li>
                <li>Employees gain a holistic view of the organization’s work</li>
                <li>Working together better fulfills the needs of multiple departments. Collaborative work also allows team members to bring their individual work styles, skills, and perspectives to other projects, giving us the chance to tackle new challenges, as well as opening up possibilities for new solutions and better results.</li>
            </ol>
